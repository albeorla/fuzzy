  P0 (Critical Priority)

  1. Remove Hardcoded Special Cases
    - Remove all hardcoded logic tied to specific strings in all components
    - Affected files: facades.py, algorithms.py, repositories.py
    - Success: All special case handling is removed, algorithms work generically
  2. Fix Test-Driven Hardcoding
    - Refactor tests to verify general algorithm properties not specific outputs
    - Focus on property-based testing approach
    - Success: Tests validate behavior consistently across varied inputs
  3. Performance Optimization
    - Implement preprocessing caching for candidate lists
    - Add batch processing for similarity calculations
    - Optimize candidate generation in repositories
    - Success: 50%+ performance improvement on large datasets

  P1 (High Priority)

  1. Robust Error Handling
    - Replace print statements with proper logging
    - Add custom exception types for specific error scenarios
    - Implement input validation at API boundaries
    - Success: All error paths are properly handled with appropriate feedback
  2. Code Complexity Reduction
    - Break down large methods into smaller focused functions
    - Refactor complex conditional logic
    - Success: No method exceeds 25 lines, cyclomatic complexity below 10

  P2 (Medium Priority)

  1. Type System Improvements
    - Reduce reliance on type casting
    - Refine type hints and protocols
    - Remove redundant type conversions
    - Success: 90% reduction in type casting usage
  2. Scalability Enhancements
    - Provide example database-backed repository implementation
    - Document scalability limitations and strategies
    - Success: Library works efficiently with 100K+ entity datasets

  P3 (Low Priority)

  1. Performance Benchmarking
    - Create benchmark suite for key operations
    - Add CI reporting for performance metrics
    - Success: Regular performance measurements with regression detection
  2. Timeout Mechanisms
    - Implement configurable timeouts for long-running operations
    - Add resource limitation checks
    - Success: All operations fail gracefully under resource constraints

  P4 (Nice to Have)

  1. Codebase Reorganization
    - Consider moving to src/ layout
    - Update dependency management
    - Success: Improved package structure following best practices
